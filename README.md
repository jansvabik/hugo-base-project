# Hugo base project

[![Open in Visual Studio Code](https://open.vscode.dev/badges/open-in-vscode.svg)](https://open.vscode.dev/jansvabik/hugo-base-project)

This repository contains a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) project template. It can be forked, cloned, or copied for starting new project with this technology. However, there are more technologies and processes implemented for minimizing human actions during starting new project.

## What's in-the-box

There is a lot of ready-to-use features. You'll rather want to remove those that you're not going to use in your project. You can use, edit or remove these prepared features:

* Sass basic files, structure and settings (in a way I use it)
* Two content files (homepages for two langs)
* Multilingual settings (in `config.toml`, `content/` and `i18n/`)
* Prepared basic HTML layout
* `robots.txt` file where everything is allowed and sitemap link added
* `typographied` partial for passing text to it, as a result, edited text with Czech typographical rules applied will be returned
* script for creating new files for new components (check [this](#new-component))
* `.browserlistrc` with some basic settings
* pre-configured postcss (autoprefixer, minifier, purgecss)
* `netlify.toml` file for cases when deployed on Netlify
* ready for use with Forestry blocks (see `layouts/_default/{home,list,single}.html` and `layouts/partials/component.html`)

## Scripts

There are several scripts which make the development process faster and more comfortable. They are located in `scripts` directory and they are usually added to `Makefile` for simpler usage.

### New component

There is a `make component name=component-name` command for adding new component. It automatically creates `.scss` and `.html` file in corresponding directories, which are:

* for `.scss` file -> `assets/sass/components/_component-name.scss`
* for `.html` file -> `layouts/partials/components/component-name.html`
* it also includes the `.scss` file to `assets/sass/main.scss` file

After checking that those files still don't exist and creating them, it'll also automatically open them in VS Code, if installed with CLI.
